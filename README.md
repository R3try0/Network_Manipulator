# Network Manipulator

**Network Manipulator** is a powerful tool designed for network analysis and manipulation. By leveraging ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), it scans the local network to identify connected devices, providing users with valuable insights into their network environment. Additionally, it offers functionality for MAC address spoofing, allowing users to change their device's MAC address for privacy or testing purposes.
